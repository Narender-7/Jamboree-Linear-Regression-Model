**Column Profiling**
1. Serial No. (Unique row ID)
2. GRE Scores (out of 340)
3. TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
4. University Rating (out of 5)
5. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
6. Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
7. Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
8. Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)

**Recommendations:**
1. Students with Research have higher chance of of admit
2. Higher GRE Score, TOEFL Score and CGPA means higher chance of admit
3. The model predicts with an accurancy of 82%
4. University Ranking doesn't seem to have a significant impact on Admission
